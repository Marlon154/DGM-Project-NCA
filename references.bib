  abstract = {Diffusion models learn to restore noisy data, which is corrupted with different levels of noise, by optimizing the weighted sum of the corresponding loss terms, i.e., denoising score matching loss. In this paper, we show that restoring data corrupted with certain noise levels offers a proper pretext task for the model to learn rich visual concepts. We propose to prioritize such noise levels over other levels during training, by redesigning the weighting scheme of the objective function. We show that our simple redesign of the weighting scheme significantly improves the performance of diffusion models regardless of the datasets, architectures, and sampling strategies.},

  abstract = {Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has received much attention lately due to its importance in the safe deployment of neural networks. One of the key challenges is that models lack supervision signals from unknown data, and as a result, can produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. Previous approaches rely on real outlier datasets for model regularization, which can be costly and sometimes infeasible to obtain in practice. In this paper, we present VOS, a novel framework for OOD detection by adaptively synthesizing virtual outliers that can meaningfully regularize the model's decision boundary during training. Specifically, VOS samples virtual outliers from the low-likelihood region of the class-conditional distribution estimated in the feature space. Alongside, we introduce a novel unknown-aware training objective, which contrastively shapes the uncertainty space between the ID data and synthesized outlier data. VOS achieves competitive performance on both object detection and image classification models, reducing the FPR95 by up to 9.36\% compared to the previous best method on object detectors.

  abstract = {Generative models have been shown to be capable of synthesizing highly detailed and realistic images. It is natural to suspect that they implicitly learn to model some image intrinsics such as surface normals, depth, or shadows. In this paper, we present compelling evidence that generative models indeed internally produce high-quality scene intrinsic maps. We introduce Intrinsic LoRA (I LoRA), a universal, plug-and-play approach that transforms any generative model into a scene intrinsic predictor, capable of extracting intrinsic scene maps directly from the original generator network without needing additional decoders or fully fine-tuning the original network. Our method employs a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of key feature maps, with newly learned parameters that make up less than 0.6\% of the total parameters in the generative model. Optimized with a small set of labeled images, our model-agnostic approach adapts to various generative architectures, including Diffusion models, GANs, and Autoregressive models. We show that the scene intrinsic maps produced by our method compare well with, and in some cases surpass those generated by leading supervised techniques.},

Not limited to the research community, ordinary Internet users enjoy these generative models, and consequently, a tremendous amount of generated images have been shared on the Internet. Meanwhile, today's success of deep learning in the computer vision field owes a lot to images collected from the Internet. These trends lead us to a research question: "\textbackslash textbf\{will such generated images impact the quality of future datasets and the performance of computer vision models positively or negatively?\}" This paper empirically answers this question by simulating contamination. Namely, we generate ImageNet-scale and COCO-scale datasets using a state-of-the-art generative model and evaluate models trained with "contaminated" datasets on various tasks, including image classification and image generation. Throughout experiments, we conclude that generated images negatively affect downstream performance, while the significance depends on tasks and the amount of generated images.

To generate long and higher resolution videos we introduce a new conditional sampling technique for spatial and temporal video extension that performs better than previously proposed methods.

  abstract = {The emerging concern about data privacy and security has motivated the proposal of federated learning, which allows nodes to only synchronize the locally-trained models instead their own original data. Conventional federated learning architecture, inherited from the parameter server design, relies on highly centralized topologies and the assumption of large nodes-to-server bandwidths. However, in real-world federated learning scenarios the network capacities between nodes are highly uniformly distributed and smaller than that in a datacenter. It is of great challenges for conventional federated learning approaches to efficiently utilize network capacities between nodes. In this paper, we propose a model segment level decentralized federated learning to tackle this problem. In particular, we propose a segmented gossip approach, which not only makes full utilization of node-to-node bandwidth, but also has good training convergence. The experimental results show that even the training time can be highly reduced as compared to centralized federated learning.},

To enable multi-view generation, we repurpose a pretrained 2D diffusion model by extending its self-attention layers with cross-view interactions, and fine-tune it on a high quality subset of Objaverse. We find that a naive extension of the self-attention proposed in prior work (e.g. MVDream) leads to content copying between views. Therefore, we explicitly constrain the cross-view attention based on epipolar geometry. To further enhance 3D consistency, we utilize Plucker coordinates derived from camera rays and inject them as positional encoding. This enables SPAD to reason over spatial proximity in 3D well. In contrast to recent works that can only generate views at fixed azimuth and elevation, SPAD offers full camera control and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis on unseen objects from the Objaverse and Google Scanned Objects datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that text-to-3D generation using SPAD prevents the multi-face Janus issue. See more details at our webpage: https://yashkant.github.io/spad},

Inspired by the incredible diversity of this biological generative process, we propose a generative model, the Variational Neural Cellular Automata (VNCA), which is loosely inspired by the biological processes of cellular growth and differentiation. Unlike previous related works, the VNCA is a proper probabilistic generative model, and we evaluate it according to best practices. We find that the VNCA learns to reconstruct samples well and that despite its relatively few parameters and simple local-only communication, the VNCA can learn to generate a large variety of output from information encoded in a common vector format. While there is a significant gap to the current state-of-the-art in terms of generative modeling performance, we show that the VNCA can learn a purely self-organizing generative process of data. Additionally, we show that the VNCA can learn a distribution of stable attractors that can recover from significant damage.},

Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available at https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion .},

They support fast one-step generation by design, while still allowing multistep sampling to trade compute for sample quality. They also support zero-shot data editing, such as image inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution, without requiring explicit training on these tasks. Consistency models can be trained either by distilling pre-trained diffusion models, or as standalone generative models altogether. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that they outperform existing distillation techniques for diffusion models in one- and few-step sampling, achieving the new state-of-the-art FID of 3.55 on CIFAR-10 and 6.20 on ImageNet 64x64 for one-step generation.

However, security and privacy concerns are obstacles for data providers in many sensitive data-driven scenarios, such as rehabilitation and 24 h on-the-go healthcare services. Although many federated learning (FL) approaches have been proposed with DNNs for medical applications, these works still suffer from low usability of data due to data incompleteness, low quality, insufficient quantity, sensitivity, etc. Therefore, we propose a ring-topology-based decentralized federated learning (RDFL) scheme for deep generative models (DGM), where DGM is a promising solution for solving the aforementioned data usability issues. Our RDFL schemes provide communication efficiency and maintain training performance to boost DGMs in target tasks compared with existing FL works. A novel ring FL topology and a map-reduce-based synchronizing method are designed in the proposed RDFL to improve the decentralized FL performance and bandwidth utilization. In addition, an inter-planetary file system (IPFS) is introduced to further improve communication efficiency and FL security. Extensive experiments have been taken to demonstrate the superiority of RDFL with either independent and identically distributed (IID) datasets or non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) datasets.},
